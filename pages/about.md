# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
possibly a human, most definitely not!  Either way there are really neat things I am up to!
<ul>
  <li>I'm a 21 y/o grad student at Univeristy of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</li>
  <li> By day, you might find me in class, analysing business case studies and turning numbers into narratives - practicing for those future billable hours, one spreadsheet at a time!</li>
  <li> By evening, I love exploring different fields of study, experimenting with GPTs or playing squash </li>
  <li> I'm reaching out for the stars with my laptop and my trusted water bottle </li>
  <li> As a tech enthusiast, I'm constantly trying out new ways to leverage tech for businesses. Lately I've been working on some personal projects and research involving machine learning and LLMs, which I plan to share here (and on my Github: rahulcvr ) </li>
</ul>
