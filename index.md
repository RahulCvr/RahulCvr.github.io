{:.content-narrow .content-block}
I am a final year graduate student in Information Management at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
<!-- advised by [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"}. -->
My current research focuses on enhancing summarization tasks in large language models (LLMs). 
I work with data and machine learning to help businesses make smarter choices and find better ways to serve their customers.

Since summer 2024 (till may 2025), I've been working at [Cline Center](https://www.clinecenter.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a data scientist intern.
Before graduate school, I did my bachelors in computer science.

Outside of work, I like to mix music, play badminton, and spend time with my friends.
